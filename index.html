                    Dora was born in Houston, Texas. She moved to Austin, Texas in August of 2008 to attend The
                    University of Texas.
                    She graduated in May of 2012 with a Bachelor of Arts in Spanish and a minor in Mathematics.
                    Dora currently works for a tech company as one of their senior advisors in technical support. She
                    has
                    experience with troubleshooting iOS, watchOS, macOS and iPadOS, as well as the hardware of it. She
                    has a
                    passion for helping people and loves finding solutions for complex issues.
                    She is currently enrolled in the UT BootCamp for Full Stack-Flex
                    Development and would love to be in a role where she can utilize all her skill sets.

                <p>
                    When she is not working or coding, Dora loves to train her three dogs in obedience. She has a
                    dachshund
                    pug mix named Arsenal, a corgi mix named Artemis and a puppy sherpherd mix named Max.
                    She loves
                    the Star Wars universe as well as the Marvel Cinematic Universe. She reads the comic books and also
                    watches
                    the movies and TV shows. Dora also loves binge watching crime shows and Korean dramas.

                    Dora admires Princess Leia from Star Wars for the reason that she continues to push foward and be a
                    leader despite
                    all the odds being stacked against her. Dora uses this as motivation to do the same in her personal
                    and
                    work life.
