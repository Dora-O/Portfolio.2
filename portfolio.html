            <p>Created an app that allows the user create their own hero lineup with Marvel characters.
                <br>
                User is given a search bar so that they can search for a Marvel character.
                <br>
                User is given the character name, the bio (if said hero has one listed in the Marvel API ie Gambit does
                not), an image of said hero, and any movies/shows the character has been in.
                <br>
                User is presented with a save button that allows them to save up to six characters for their hero
                lineup.
                <br>
                The hero lineup will show the characters images.
                <br>
                If the user searches for a hero not found in the Marvel API (ie She-Hulk, Ant-Man etc) or it is not a
                character in the Marvel universe they will get a notification saying said character could not be found
                and/or verify the name was spelled exaclty how Marvel spells it.
                <br>
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bulma were used for the application.
