            <p>Created an app that allows the user create their own hero lineup with Marvel characters.
                <br>
                User is given a search bar so that they can search for a Marvel character.
                <br>
                User is given the character name, the bio (if said hero has one listed in the Marvel API ie Gambit does
                not), an image of said hero, and any movies/shows the character has been in.
                <br>
                User is presented with a save button that allows them to save up to six characters for their hero
                lineup.
                <br>
                The hero lineup will show the characters images.
                <br>
                If the user searches for a hero not found in the Marvel API (ie She-Hulk, Ant-Man etc) or it is not a
                character in the Marvel universe they will get a notification saying said character could not be found
                and/or verify the name was spelled exaclty how Marvel spells it.
                <br>
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bulma were used for the application.

            <h4>Code Quiz</h4>
            <img src="images/104857336-64f92b80-58dd-11eb-9857-ee3a20eeaa62.png" alt="image of what the website looks like"

            <p>
                Created a time quiz that asks the user questions about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
                <br>
                The application itself was created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                <br>
                User has sixty seconds to answer ten questions. 
                <br>
                For every question that the user gets correct, they get ten points added to their score. 
                <br>
                For every question the user gets incorrect, five points get deducted from score as well as five seconds deducted from timer. 
                <br>
                User will also see an alert box appear for every correct/incorrect answer.
                <br>
                After timer reaches zero or user has answered all ten questions; a prompt will appear to capture the user's initials so that the score can be saved. 
                <br>
                Prompt will also appear if time tries to go below zero after many incorrect answers. After user inputs initials, the screen will show how many points the user
                got.
                <br>
                User is then able to click on "View Scores" and see all locally saved users with their scores.

            <h4>Weather Dashboard</h4>

                id="scimg3">
            <p>
                Created an app that allows the user to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that they can plan
                accordingly.
                <br>
                User is given a dashboard with forms of input so that they can search for a city with current and future
                weather conditions.
                <br>
                User is given the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature,
                the humidity the wind speed and the UV index.
                <br>
                When viewing the index the user is presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are
                favorable, moderate or severe.
                <br>
                User is presented with 5 day forecasts that display the date, an icon of representation of weather
                conditions, temperature and humidity when viewing future weather conditions for city they choose.
                <br>
                UV Index colors: favorable will be green, moderate will be yellow/orange and severe will be red/purple.
                <br>
                Application will save the five most recent searches.
                <br>
                User is able to click on a city in the search history and presented with previous information of
                weather.
                <br>
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript and bootstrap were used for application.
